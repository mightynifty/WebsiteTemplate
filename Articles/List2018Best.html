                        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 has been one hell of a year. Currently I&rsquo;m recovering from last night&rsquo;s New Years Eve party, working on this video with absolutely nothing done on about 4 hours of sleep. And yet, I am </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">determined </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">to share this list with you. Not for my sake, but to give credit to the amazing works of art released this year. So I&rsquo;m gonna put on my best commentary voice and get right into it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While maybe not as mind-blowing for the industry as last year, 2018 had a lot of fantastic titles and I tried my best to play as many as I could. And while I couldn&rsquo;t get around to everything on my list I&rsquo;m definitely going into 2019 with a smile on my face. But here&rsquo;s to the games that I&rsquo;ve heard are fun, but unfortunately missed out on. Perhaps in another life, but alas this year it wasn&rsquo;t meant to be: Ashen, Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Odyssey, Black Ops 4, Far Cry 5, Hitman 2, and Return of the Obra Dinn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&rsquo;re curious I left a list of every game I did play in the description down below, with a total of 48 games! That&rsquo;s a lot to talk about so with that said let&rsquo;s get started with the honorable mentions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Honorable Mentions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wouldn&rsquo;t be a 2018 list without a battle royale title on it. And the best battle royale game I&rsquo;ve played this year is Darwin Project. With a smaller player count than your typical battle royale game, 10 players on a map fight for survival by collecting resources and building tools and traps to help eliminate opponents.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gameplay is fun, well designed, and absolutely addictive, moving at a much faster pace than other battle royale games I&rsquo;ve played. And there&rsquo;s an eleventh player in the form of the director, able to manipulate the game with buffs and map changes to keep things interesting, with Twitch integration and everything.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And did I mention that the game is free to play without any intrusive microtransactions? Honestly I feel like I&rsquo;m ripping off the developers every time I give this game a shot simply because of how much fun I&rsquo;m having at no cost, but that&rsquo;s exactly why I recommend this game to anyone with a PC who thinks it might be worth checking out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gris is a short puzzle platformer game. It&rsquo;s honestly not though&hellip; It&rsquo;s hard to describe. See, you do jump around and solve a puzzle here and there, but neither of those is particularly challenging. Instead I&rsquo;d put this in the experimental category of games such as Journey and Flower.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The music is beautiful, the artwork is magnificent, and the animation is a treat to behold. If you&rsquo;re looking for a short relaxing game that&rsquo;ll really bring you into the artistry of the medium I highly recommend you give this one a shot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guacamelee 2 is a metroidvania just like the first. Playing as Juan the luchador, you&rsquo;ll smash, explore, and chicken your way to saving the mexiverse. A bit too similar to the first game for me personally and the addition of co-op is cool, but a bit too hectic if playing partner isn&rsquo;t perfectly on your skill level, but if you&rsquo;re looking for a beat-em-up platformer with some clever writing and fantastic gameplay, be sure to try this one out for yourself!</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nintendo Labo Vehicle Kit is absolutely genius. As a kid I would have loved it and I know that because as an adult I absolutely love it. From concept to execution the Nintendo Labo is the most creative thing to come out of the gaming industry this generation and I do plan on eventually doing a video on it trying to see just how far the concept can be pushed.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue with this game is unfortunately&hellip; the game. While not as basic as the other two kits from what I&rsquo;ve heard, the vehicle kit&rsquo;s lackluster open world exploration gameplay and tedious fuel mechanic lack a lot of the creativity and originality that comes from making the devices themselves. Still, if you have kids or just enjoy puzzles and this looks appealing you you, I can definitely give this a thumbs up!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game I wish I had more time with this year. I got it as a Christmas gift recently and as a result I&rsquo;m only a little ways into the campaign. From what I&rsquo;ve experienced so far the game has a gorgeous open world with entertaining characters, dialogue, set pieces, and action sequences.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although with that there are some minor complaints. Personally, I tend to find Rockstar&rsquo;s control schemes to be a bit stiff, which is certainly true here. And the need to perform each action one at a time becomes pretty damn tedious after a while.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I had to guess I&rsquo;d say this game would&rsquo;ve probably ended up around the middle of the list had I more time to give it a go, but for now it&rsquo;ll have to settle in nice and cozy right here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other games that deserve a mention here include Donut County (specifically on iOS not the bloated PC price), Monster Hunter World, Super Mario Party, and Florence.&nbsp; With that taken care of I just want to mention each of these honorable mentions had something about it that juuuust brought it down a notch, but if any of them seem like something you&rsquo;re interested in you should definitely give them a shot. That said, it&rsquo;s time to get into the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">real</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> list. THESE are my top 10 favorite games of 2018!</span></p>
<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong> Dragon Ball FighterZ</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dragon Ball FighterZ is a stellar fast-paced fighting game that truly captures how a fight in the series feels. The roster, animation, gorgeous visuals, and stellar gameplay make for a superb fighting experience. Even when I&rsquo;m getting the shit kicked out of me I still marvel at the incredible spectacle on screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it&rsquo;s so far down this list because of the tedious single player campaign and irritatingly slow menus combined with a need to be online when first booting up the game. That said, if you&rsquo;re looking for a fun 2D fighter or you&rsquo;re a fan of the series you really can&rsquo;t go wrong here.</span></p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong> Shadow of the Colossus Remastered</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some games offer to take players to brand new worlds and wow them with atmosphere. Others give us a chance to experience spectacle on a scale the real world simply can&rsquo;t offer. And then there are the games that let us ride around on the best horse ever. Shadow of the Colossus does all three while also being one of the most visually stunning games of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A simple game, devoid of any enemies save for 18 massive colossi, making for 18 of the most impressive boss fights in the history of gaming. Each is like a puzzle platforming challenge, tasking the player with trying to figure out how to climb these beasts to give their weak points a taste of your sword&rsquo;s pointy end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a game that should be put in a museum as an example of the artistry the gaming medium is capable of. With epic being the only word I can use to describe nearly every battle. There are some flaws with climbing issues, some repetitive elements of fights after the first attack, and the open world feeling a bit too empty for my taste, but if you haven&rsquo;t played this game yet I can&rsquo;t recommend it highly enough.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong> Detroit: Become Human</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ughhhh, I hate that I enjoy this game so much. Detroit: Become Human&rsquo;s plot is cheesy and by the numbers, the metaphors and subtext are overly blatant and poorly written, and the choice system is limited and stilted all evidence of a lack of quality in the game&rsquo;s direction, but god damn this game is a fun ride.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a lot of that has to do with the well-written characters and dialogue. I cared about what happened because I cared about these androids and while I could spend all day listing the game&rsquo;s issues and praises it&rsquo;s honestly not worth it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a love it or hate it game, evident by the different opinions presented by both me and Zubatticus in my review earlier this year, but the only way to find out if this is a game for you is to pick it up and play it for yourself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> The Messenger</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Messenger is a metroidvania platformer with the main gimmick being the player&rsquo;s ability to switch back and forth between 8 bit and 16 bit designs, but it&rsquo;s so much more than that. Not only are the graphics and animation lovingly crafted to fit with their respective styles, but the transition is just perfectly done, with the music changing as well to really sell the effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even more than that the game itself is addictingly fantastic. I was about ready to wrap up my list when I got it for free from Twitch Prime and figured I&rsquo;d give it a shot. After writing a piece similar to Red Dead&rsquo;s in the honorable mentions due to not playing it enough I was ready to be done, but then&hellip; I&nbsp; kept playing. And playing. And by 5AM the next morning I 100 percented the game!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The writing is hilarious, the gameplay stays consistently varied and well-designed, the mechanics are utilized to their full extent, and have I mentioned the incredible soundtrack? If you have any interest in platformers and don&rsquo;t mind a bit of frustrating design from time to time then this game&rsquo;s sure to leave you saying &ldquo;Alright! I&rsquo;m a delivery boy!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> Octopath Traveler</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This game taught me what it means to love a JRPG. By which I mean the various systems and gameplay styles present in this genre of game. On its own Octopath Traveler is a gorgeous game with an incredible soundtrack that&rsquo;s a blast to play, but while each individual story is fun, the game as a whole feels disconnected as a result of the branching paths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the characters are well written, the plotlines are gripping and investing, and that&rsquo;s without mentioning the combat. Breaking opponents&rsquo; shields, figuring out weaknesses, and the litany of variations brought to the standard turn-based system come together to make the end product a joy to play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s a fantastic proof of concept and as someone who&rsquo;s never played a Square Enix RPG before I can honestly say this is a stellar introduction to their catalog with fun characters, intriguing stories, and plotlines that balance perfectly between fun adventures and emotional quests, but the lack of any meaningful character interaction or overarching plotline leave it just out of the top 5.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the rest of this list was incredibly difficult to order. And I could have easily felt differently one day or the next, but after a lot of deliberation this is the conclusion I came to&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Smash Brothers is one of my favorite franchises in all of gaming. A collaborative effort from numerous studios bringing the biggest names in gaming together to beat each other to a bloody pulp. It&rsquo;s&hellip; It&rsquo;s just so beautiful. And Smash Ultimate has, in my opinion, the best core gameplay the series has seen to date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest roster with everyone included, an insane number of stages all with omega and battlefield forms, hundreds upon hundreds of music tracks, eye-catching visuals in both the game and menus, and an extensive single player campaign all come together to ensure that this game easily earns the &ldquo;Ultimate&rdquo; in its title.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would have easily taken the spot for game of the year if it hadn&rsquo;t been for a few small issues. The removal of traditional modes like home run contest, the lack of trophies, and tedious nature of the World of Light campaign (which, by the way, only has like 3 cinematics, which is pretty disappointing) are all problems, but the killing blow that knocks this game down the list is the online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the matchmaking system absolutely atrocious with the removal of For Glory, but after a match the game doesn&rsquo;t let you change your character before rematching with your opponent, making switching up your strategy impossible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pile onto that the abundance of lag and lack of dedicated servers that leave the game worse off than Smash 4 despite requiring players to pay for online connectivity now and.. Yeah, I love this game with a passion, but it&rsquo;s just too flawed to be placed any higher on the list, but if you have a Switch this is still a must-own game for your collection.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Spider-Man</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marvel&rsquo;s Spider-Man is a game that really make you FEEL like Spider-Man&hellip; But no, like it really does though. One of these days I might make a video on just how and why it does that, but for now I&rsquo;ll just say that the story is great, the characters are well written, the visuals are impressive given the scale this game operates on, and the gameplay is fluid and fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it certainly takes a lot from the Batman Arkham games in terms of combat, Spidey&rsquo;s creative and unique arsenal combined with the intuitive and perfectly responsive controls make this game a thing of beauty in action. Even this game&rsquo;s version of detective mode is contextually relevant due to Peter&rsquo;s spidey sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stealth and combat are both a blast and the main missions are entertaining, but what really put this game over the edge is unprecedented traversal of New York City. All of the fluid animations made it so that the Ubisoft-style open world with a myriad of pointless tasks to complete and macguffins to gather felt like a joy to explore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the icing on the cake is the story. Peter Parker, Otto Octavius, Aunt May, MJ, just some of the most lovable and investing characters I&rsquo;ve seen in any Spider-Man property to date. Marvel&rsquo;s Spider-Man is a game that embraces its hero wholeheartedly and results in one of the best superhero games I&rsquo;ve ever played.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> God of War</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As some of you may know, I&rsquo;m kind of a fan of the god of war games. Having spent a significant portion of the year playing and explaining my in-depth thoughts on the first three games in the series. And after all of that, with this newest release I can now say God of War 2018&hellip; is my second favorite after God of War 2. Still awesome though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking Kratos to a new realm of the Norse gods made for a wonderful change of scenery for the series and this is the first entry to date that feels like a true evolution of what defines a God of War game while still maintaining the elements that made this series special to begin with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insane graphical fidelity, Emotionally gripping characterization, and fast, responsive gameplay that feels like God of War 3 and Dark Souls made some sweet sweet love to one another produces one of the best games this year and a must-have game for anyone with a PS4. I can&rsquo;t wait to see what comes next when we join Kratos and Atreus on another journey in the future.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Celeste</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do you follow up an epic open-world adventure with a gripping narrative and massive triple-A budget? How about with a touching, charming, challenging 8 bit-style 2D platformer from an indie developer?</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Celeste is my second favorite game of 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, this simple platformer beat out a ton of games that are much more technically impressive. How? By combining the most emotionally touching story and some of the tightest gameplay I&rsquo;ve experienced all year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celeste is a game about a girl with anxiety, afraid to face her fears. Your job is to help her overcome them as she climbs a giant mountain while avoiding the dangerous entities within, including a dark version of herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platforming is simple, but the ways these simple controls are expanded upon and utilized to create some of the most inventive levels of the year is astounding and as someone who&rsquo;s dealt with depression myself I won&rsquo;t lie- this story brought a tear to my eye.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With loveable characters, stellar gameplay, and beautiful visuals despite their simplicity, Celeste is a game that I think just about everyone should give a shot at least once.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Distance</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now we have the final game on this list. My favorite game of the year. We&rsquo;ve seen beautiful presentation, emotional stories, and gameplay polished to a tee thus far, so what stood out to me above the rest?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distance is my game of the year for 2018. Haven&rsquo;t heard of it? I&rsquo;m not surprised. Released by refract studios, this game didn&rsquo;t make a big splash upon release from early access.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn&rsquo;t have the best graphics despite them being visually impressive. The story is lackluster and too ambiguous to be gripping. The controls can be confusing and a bit too precise at times. So how could it possibly beat out every other game I played this year? Simple- it&rsquo;s fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blasting through a level, jumping from floor to wall to ceiling to flying through the air, loop-de-loops, obstacles to avoid, it&rsquo;s all stuff that&rsquo;s been done before, but it&rsquo;s just done soooo well here it&rsquo;s an absolute blast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The single player contains a ton of levels, each with a simple goal-reach the end. But the gameplay puts you in charge of literally every aspect of your vehicle&rsquo;s movement. Using your boost you can gain speed, but have to reach a checkpoint in time to prevent overheating. Using thrusters you can jump while also adjusting your car in mid-air, making every single action in this game up to you, the player.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, this car can fly. By pressing the jump button twice, you can transform the car into a plane and take off to the sky until your boost runs out. Between managing your boost and the seamless transition at play here, Distance is a no-nonsense driving game that succeeds at nearly everything it attempts to accomplish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, and that&rsquo;s not all, there&rsquo;s online modes with races and other competitions that work flawlessly, multiple other modes for single player including time trials and a Tony Hawk&rsquo;s Pro Skater-eque points mode, and even a crazy-extensive level editor which some people have used to make some incredible tracks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s not the most well-known game and it&rsquo;s one I feel has gone under the radar, but for the price the value this game offers is insane and the amount of fun I had with this game is something that proves just how much passion there was behind its development and I think it&rsquo;s criminal for it to go overlooked.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have even the slightest interest in anything on your screen right now, be sure to check it out. And if not, watch this and see if a sample of the gameplay along with the best soundtrack of the year can change your mind!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, 2018 was a year with a lot of highs and lows and while I don&rsquo;t think it quite lived up to the powerhouse of the preceding year, it was still a privilege to get to play all of these games.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to check out my list of the worst games 2018 had to offer, click this link in the corner of your screen or in the description below and let me know in the comments what your favorite game of the year is or what games you&rsquo;re looking forward to in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally, I had a blast making videos this year. With my first retrospective and a couple of collaborations with some awesome content creators this has easily been my favorite year reviewing games. For next year, I&rsquo;m planning to focus on video essays and retrospectives, and might even expand my content outside of gaming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My upload schedule is gonna be a bit more sparse, but I hope you&rsquo;ll join me for what&rsquo;s to come.
