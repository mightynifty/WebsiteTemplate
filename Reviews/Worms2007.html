                        <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Worms is a simple game. 2-4 teams of worms with silly accents fight to the death on destructive terrain. The game only has deathmatch as a game mode, but it offers a ton of fun and variety. Each team is tasked with killing every member of the opposing teams. Last team to have a member still alive wins. This can be played locally, online, or in the 20 single-player challenges.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Each worm starts out with 100 HP and can be blown up, smacked, blessed, and poked to death with the huge multitude of weapons available. While none of the weapons are one-hit kills without stage hazards dealing additional damage, if a worm is hit into the water at the bottom of the stage, they&rsquo;re instantly killed. And the terrain will be destroyed if hit by a weapon, although there aren&rsquo;t any silly physics causing pieces of the environment to remain floating in the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Worms also have limited mobility during their turn. They can crawl, jump, backflip, and use weapons like the ninja rope, jetpack, blowtorch, and teleporter to get around the map. They all have their ups and downs, but traversing the environment is always a risk due to the abundance of deadly mines and the worms easily taking fall damage. The primary question each turn is whether to attack for damage, attack and attempt to hit your opponent into the water, protect yourself, or get to a strategically advantageous position.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The variety comes with the randomized maps and customizable weapon loadouts. One game might be underground, preventing air support, while another might be just baseball bats and ninja ropes. Either way, the replayability here is through the roof. Each different setup leads to a myriad of different strategic possibilities and at its best, worms is like a never-ending game of chess.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">At its worst, worms can be a seemingly random mess of a game. For example, the first player to go above ground is able to find the closest player above ground and knock them into the water without risk. This simple issue could have been fixed by removing the water until every worm has taken a turn, eliminating the possibility of a defenseless insta-kill. These little nitpicks are problematic for a strategy game, but overall, they&rsquo;re miniscule issues that can be overlooked for one important reason: this isn&rsquo;t meant to be a hard core strategy game, just a fun one. Worms is like the Mario Kart of strategy games- fun, frantic, and often unbalanced, but that unbalanced keeps the game fun.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The part of the game that is a major problem is the single player. Now I know this is primarily a multiplayer game, but if you&rsquo;re gonna tack on a single-player mode it&rsquo;s going to be judged as a part of the game and unfortunately this mode is really shallow. Of course, having 20 challenges wasn&rsquo;t meant to be the deepest gaming experience, but the effort put in is minimal. Every level is just the player in a deathmatch against 1-3 other teams of computers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The rules are broken here so that the player gets to go every other turn, but even so, considering that the other teams will always aim for the player and never each other, it gets frustrating. Seriously, friendly fire is always on anyway, so having the computers be on three different teams serves no purpose besides giving you the same feeling you get when everyone at the party teams up on you for no reason. It&rsquo;s frustrating and could have been solved by simply making the opponent one big team instead of 3 normal-sized ones.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Even more frustrating is how monotonous the levels become. Why not challenge the player to use various items in certain ways? Bazooka only without allowing the worms to move, melee only, flying the jetpack through rings, anything! Any kind of variety to make the game feel fresh and new would have been much appreciated. The worst problem of all is the complete mixed bag that is the AI. They may have different levels of intelligence, but I could never tell you what they are.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Every single computer boils down to two traits: impeccable aim and terrible strategy. Every shot, even from the lowest-level computer players, is fired at the player with pinpoint accuracy to the point where you want to run and hide underground rather than stand and fight. On top of that, they are so easy to manipulate it&rsquo;s not even funny. If they can&rsquo;t move, or attack, they&rsquo;ll never think to jetpack or ninja rope away. They&rsquo;ll always either use a weapon to make a small hole in the environment or teleport to the nearest item crate. If the player has a worm that is in any way able to be hit by a weapon, they will be hit. However, the computers also have some of the dumbest strategies I&rsquo;ve ever seen. They&rsquo;ll fire bazookas at walls 3 inches from their faces, plant dynamite and then just stand around waiting to get blown up, and sometimes just straight up commit suicide.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Even with all of these flaws, the gameplay is still some of the most enjoyable strategic fun you can have. The games are also quick enough to be sure they won&rsquo;t overstay their welcome due to a sudden death mode activating after a certain amount of play time, leading to hours of fun with a group of friends and only a little bit of frustration. Sure, there&rsquo;ll be times you&rsquo;ll blow yourself up because the bazooka&rsquo;s collision detection made it hit the floor instead of the area below that you AIMED AT, but in the end, there&rsquo;s really no game in this style that can compete with the still reigning king that is Worms.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Sure it needs a bit more variety, sure it needs a bit more effort, love, and care, but Worms is just as enjoyable now as it was when it first came out. That&rsquo;s why my rating for Worms 2007 is&hellip; 7.5 exploding sheep out of 10. I hope they can switch up the formula next time around because this is one franchise that deserves to be back in the limelight. That&rsquo;s all for me though.
