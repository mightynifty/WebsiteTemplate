                        <p>The subject of loss is a difficult thing to tackle. How can anyone truly convey the feeling of losing someone close to them through art? Well that's exactly the goal of Mojiken Studio's game When The Past Was Around. This short, seven dollar indie game follows a woman dealing with the loss of a loved one. We see their lives together and see how she copes with her partner's passing. The gameplay is your typical point and click fair- click everything, find objects, solve puzzles, and I gotta say, some of these really had me stumped for a while, but the solutions could hardly be called too obtuse. The story is pretty good too, with the ending leaving me with a few goosebumps through its beauty and music. The game can drag a bit in the beginning with a lot of slow cutscenes, vague imagery, and repetitive audio, but it all pays off in the end. You may not know this, but I actually covered one of Mojiken's other games, A Raven Monologue, in an indie spotlight video a few years back and ever since I've been looking forward to what this studio would come up with next and thanks to fun puzzles, a gorgeous art style, and a touching story, I'll continue to keep them on my radar because When The Past Was Around definitely lived up to expectations.</p>
