                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;ve been playing tennis for years now. Ever since watching the Prince of Tennis in middle school and getting out onto the court to give it a try it&rsquo;s been my sport of choice. So when I heard that Nintendo and Camelot were coming together to make another entry in the Mario Tennis series I was really excited to dive into another fantastic sports game from the franchise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I finally got my hands on Mario Tennis Ultra Smash and all of that excitement faded away. Boring to play and not much to do, it&rsquo;s obvious the company abandoned this game when they realized the Wii U was failing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now only 3 years later, the developer has released another title in the series, Mario Tennis Aces. With the return of the story mode and more fleshed out features, let&rsquo;s see if this is the tennis experience fans have been waiting for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game begins by throwing players into the story mode right out of the gate. Mario and Peach have just won the Mushroom Kingdom tennis tournament when all of a sudden Wario and Waluigi appear with a dangerous looking racquet. Tempted by its power, Luigi takes hold and all three are taken over by the evil power inside.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After their escape, Mario and Toad are sent out on a journey by Peach and Daisy. They uncover the secret of the racquet&rsquo;s origins and must retrieve the vague macguffins called power stones before their brainwashed companions. They go off and retrieve the power stones one by one until ready to face off against the evil racquet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story here is kind of interesting. It&rsquo;s not good or compelling, but it&rsquo;s one of the few times we&rsquo;ve actually gotten to see some personality from the mushroom kingdom inhabitants and it&rsquo;s pretty cool. The game also has a great tongue-in-cheek sense about it, pointing out how ludicrous it is that every problem in this world is solved with a game of tennis. It&rsquo;s nothing amazing, but I got a chuckle here and there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from that there are three main mission types- tennis matches, mini games, and boss battles. Each comes with a bit of dialogue before and after, giving each match a sense of purpose in the world. Traversal is easy as well with a world map that can be travelled through as well as a fast travel system for objectives further away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downside to this is the lack of any kind of replay button. The dialogue is a cute addition, but if a mission is failed, the game kicks you out of the match, then makes you click through the text boxes, reinitiate the stage, and click through the intro text again just to replay.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It slows things down to a crawl and adds even more frustration to some of the more challenging stages. When I fail I want to get right back into the action and try again, so this is a pretty big oversight that just had me giving up on some of the more difficult non-essential missions that I otherwise found pretty fun to play.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, when most of the missions are time-based, it means that instead of restarting a challenge you know you don&rsquo;t have time to complete, the game makes you go through this entire process and it&rsquo;s incredibly tedious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the missions there&rsquo;s one important thing to note right off the bat- you better know how to play tennis before getting into the game because surprisingly there&rsquo;s no tutorial explaining the rules of tennis in the adventure mode at all. For me personally that&rsquo;s no problem, but I could see it making a lot of kids who try this game out a bit confused, particularly when playing doubles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visually, the game is pretty slick. Typical cartoony Mario fare with a solid amount of detail and texture work. It&rsquo;s nothing that&rsquo;ll blow your mind, but it&rsquo;s nice to look at. The music on the other hand is pretty disappointing. The tracks here are pretty standard and generic for a Mario game and they repeat far too often. It never got grating for me, but if it did for someone else I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the bright side, the actual tennis in this game is pretty good. Players have 5 different shots they can choose from as well as the ability to charge them up for extra power. This game also introduces trick shots that allow each character to use their unique special maneuver to reach a ball that would otherwise be too far away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these shots have an effect on the super meter which, when charged can slow down time to make a shot easier, unleash a powerful star shot in which players can choose exactly where to hit the ball, or use everything to throw out a super move, which is similar to the star shot, but can be used from anywhere on the court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This game also introduces racquet breaking. If a super shot or star shot is hit too early or too late, the player&rsquo;s racquet takes damage. Take too much damage and your racquet breaks and if all of the racquets are broken, that player loses by KO. This is a creative use of existing tennis rules and a really nice touch, especially since power shots can be hit back without damage if timed correctly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mario also gets a pseudo-RPG stat system in adventure mode allowing him to increase his speed and agility on the court as well as collect more racquets to extend his life in a match and improve durability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately it&rsquo;s a little underwhelming due to the game&rsquo;s short adventure and the system&rsquo;s lack of depth so it comes off as a tacked on feature used to extend the playtime by holding players back with a weak character instead of challenging opponents or creative matches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of all of that there are stage hazards present on certain courts. Piranha plants, warp mirrors, shy guys running across the court that hit your balls back and this FUCKING POLE THAT ALWAYS GETS IN THE WAY AND NEVER ONCE HELPED ME OUT! I HATE THIS FUCKING THING&hellip; It&rsquo;s all here and if nothing else adds some variety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this shows just how much the development team thought about what to put into the game while still making the core tennis experience fun to play and that more time and care went into the end product than in the previous title, but it still feels like there&rsquo;s something missing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the actual tennis and super moves feel fun and cool to use, the game still feels like a whacky tennis game rather than a true Mario sports game. Like the crazy factor was set to an 8 instead of being turned up to 11.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where are the powerups? The giant courts with 4 players on each side? Why is there only one doubles match in the entire story mode? Why is Mario the only player character in the adventure until the end? It&rsquo;s just so half-baked and screams rush job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mini games are pretty much the same. Rally for as long as possible, hit these special targets, use certain shot types to get past an opponent, it&rsquo;s all entertaining while it lasts, but none of it really feels memorable or creative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shining light here however are the boss battles. There aren&rsquo;t a ton of them in this 5 hour long campaign, but those that are here are super fun. They all consist of the same kind of fight, whittling down an opponent&rsquo;s health until opening them up to a star shot and aiming for their weak spot, but the creative designs and uses of the game&rsquo;s limited mechanics make each fight well worth experiencing, with some even posing a decent challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, with a campaign that&rsquo;s 5 hours long it&rsquo;s the content outside the adventure that really matters and honestly there&rsquo;s not a ton of it. The only modes that exist are quick play and tournaments. With only meager offerings at that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of a mini game mode or training mode for getting better at specific skills in the game makes improvement difficult and frustrating. The single match exhibition mode doesn&rsquo;t allow for custom games or lobbies unless you&rsquo;re playing with friends. The computer tournaments are incredibly easy to the point of being straight up laughable.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The character selection screen is diverse in terms of looks and player types, but the game doesn&rsquo;t actually tell players what these different attributes actually mean, leaving players in the dark, and there isn&rsquo;t even a way to play a standard 6 game set, which is just baffling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the most prominent online offerings, the game stumbles as well. With the tournament mode simply being a ladder in which players face off against random opponents, with each rung granting additional ranking points for a win. The issue comes with the complete lack of quality control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&rsquo;s no way to report a player for using a lag switch or delay of game, no comparing pings to ensure the game finds a good connection, no way to jump back into a tournament if you lose, and many of the matches come down to either a complete victory or a crushing defeat since there&rsquo;s little in the way of skill comparison when selecting opponents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lag is also a constant issue as are input errors. Not enough to ruin the game, but definitely worth a mention. The worst part is the trick shots, which can be pulled off with either a flick of the right stick or by double tapping the X button. The problem here is that double tapping the X button also causes your character to lob or drop shot the ball, leading to a lot of accidental trick shots, which inevitably miss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special shots are also a concern. Here, players can choose where they want the ball to go after jumping into the air, but it moves so fast that unless players activate slow motion by burning meter or get lucky with a guess as to where their opponent will aim it&rsquo;s impossible to hit the ball back.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;d have much preferred a power shot that moves slightly faster and has the ability to damage a racquet, but can still be hit as it would have allowed for more strategy, better control, and maybe even encouraged the designers to implement a running shot, which a basic feature of tennis that&rsquo;s surprisingly absent here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, through it all, past the matching issues, lag, and general gameplay faults, Mario Tennis Aces still manages to create one of the most fun and engaging tennis experiences in the series thus far. And while I could go into how certain moves and techniques along with the roster diversity make for a fun game, it&rsquo;s all difficult to explain without having you play the game yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just trust me when I say that things can get really tense. Despite all of its shortcomings, Mario Tennis Aces is a solid entry in the series that I hope Camelot can improve upon in the future, which is why it gets a 7.5 out of 10.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it&rsquo;s another tennis game or maybe something in the Mario golf series, Camelot&rsquo;s cleary taking steps in the right direction that I hope to see continue into the future.
