                        <p>Easily the most disappointing game of the year for me is Sackboy A Big Adventure. What looked to be a new take on the LittleBigPlanet mascot in the vein of Super Mario 3D World didn't turn out awful, far from it. The game has enough charm, solid level design, and fun to be had to actually recommend playing if you can get it at a discount, but every time I started to actually have fun something bad would be just around the corner. The plot is pointless, which is fine for this type of game, but the characters, for how much they talk have nothing interesting or funny to say. Sackboy is adorable and the costumes are all great, with plenty of customization options, but the controls are far too loose and depth perception is a massive issue. Playing co-op makes things a lot more fun, even making the extremely slow pace and floaty controls sensible, but it's local only for now and just can't change how bland everything is, which is really the crux of the issue. Everything here aesthetically, thematically, and gameplay-wise feels uninspired, even when itâ€™s creatively implemented like in the music levels. New gameplay ideas are around every turn, and most of them are used in cool and unique ways, but spoiled by rudimentary design, iffy controls, and a complete lack of surprises meaning that Sackboy's big adventure is one that establishes a fantastic framework for a sequel, but misses the mark in too many ways to truly give it a thumbs up.</p>
