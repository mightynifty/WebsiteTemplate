                        <p>I'm not entirely sure what to call Paper Beast. A puzzle game? Interactive art? VR gimmick simulator? Yeah, all of those fit pretty well. In Paper Beast, you're transferred into a world of well, paper beasts. From here you're able to drag these creatures around, using each of their unique abilities to solve puzzles and progress. The game is pretty short at around 3 hours, but in spite of that it still manages to feel remarkably slow at times, with some puzzles taking so long to solve that they made me question if I even had the right solution. So why is it worthwhile? This game has some incredible atmosphere and knows how to truly envelop the player in its world. It's a unique experience unlike anything else and many of the puzzles are really fun to solve, involving a lot of unique mechanics and interesting physics dynamics. Plus that intro sequence and the god mode are a blast to mess around in. It's definitely a bit pretentious at times, but if you're looking for a new VR game that's unlike anything else on the market, and looking for something that'll leave you wanting more, I'd say Paper Beast is one to check out.</p>
