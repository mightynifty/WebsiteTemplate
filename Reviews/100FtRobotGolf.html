                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">100ft Robot Golf is a game developed by No Goblin for the PS4 in 2016. If you&rsquo;ve been watching me for a while, you may recognize this game as my favorite from PAX East last year. I only played one round, but had a blast in the split screen multiplayer while it lasted. Now that the full game is out, I think it&rsquo;s time to turn a critical eye to this absolutely ridiculous and hysterical game premise in my mighty review of 100ft Robot Golf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&rsquo;s start out with the story. It must be hysterical seeing how they rationalize using gundam-style robots to play a casual game of golf while destroying cities. ...Right? Well, yes and no. 100ft Robot Golf definitely has its share of funny moments. From the location on the map where an announcer tells jokes to the fact that you can play as a voltron parody piloted by 5 corgis, this game definitely has the right sense of humor going for it, but with that being said a lot of the comedy in this game tends to fall completely flat.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story is kind of all over the place, but this is what I gathered during my playthrough: In this world, giant robots are used to play the most honorable of all sports, 100ft Robot Golf. Prior to the events of the story, a tournament being held on the moon had issues and a massive explosion destroyed a large portion of the moon and killed a popular robot golfer. Now, one of the golfers responsible for the tournament, Max, under the orders of his boss, Vahni, must recruit the other robot golfers to compete in another tournament to both redeem themselves and bring the sport of robot golf back to its former glory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this premise should be hysterical, it&rsquo;s bogged down by numerous issues that reveal themselves immediately upon starting the game. Starting with the writing, the characters are all written like cliches. And while I understand the plot is meant to be a parody of gundam-style anime shows, they never really do anything interesting with it in terms of the story. There are a couple of chuckle-worthy moments here and there, but due to issues with the slow pacing and sometimes awkward humor, the story just doesn&rsquo;t live up to the expectations set by its premise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then there&rsquo;s the voice acting. It is without a doubt, the worst voice acting I have ever heard in my life. Accents go all over the place, inflections are almost inhuman, and it sounds like the actors are just reading their lines from a script without putting any kind of emotion into them. I&rsquo;ve heard that this is supposed to be a parody of bad anime dubbing, but I&rsquo;ve never heard anything with a dub this bad. As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, it sounds like they couldn&rsquo;t even get a decent microphone to record the vocals as p-popping and levelling problems are rampant throughout the entire campaign. It&rsquo;s a shame too. With decent voice acting, the story may have been a lot more interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visually, the game does improve a bit. During cutscenes, the artwork is fantastic and I really like each character&rsquo;s design. The different robot types and their color palettes are also usually cool. That being said, it&rsquo;s not perfect. The cutscenes choose to use a half-animated style, with the characters changing facial expressions every once in awhile to speak and fading to different positions indicating movement. This isn&rsquo;t terrible per se, but I couldn&rsquo;t help but think the game would be better off with a full animation budget or just sticking with static images.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, things get a lot better out on the course. The golf courses are varied, with 4 themes and 9 holes each, which isn&rsquo;t bad for a downloadable game. The 3D modeling is simplistic, but it works in this type of game and makes everything easier to see and understand while playing. I never experienced a frame rate issue or a loading screen lasting much longer than it should, and the sound effects while playing were usually nice to listen to as well. The best thing about this game presentation-wise though, are the commentators. They are legitimately funny, making references to the in-game absurdity and pop-culture. And they&rsquo;re actually voice acted really well, sounding just like the calm, quiet commentators usually heard in a real golf game. And the music, while rare is really good and obviously heavily inspired by Dragonball, which you won&rsquo;t hear me complaining about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are quite a few modes as well. There&rsquo;s of course free play mode in which players can duke it out in online or local splitscreen multiplayer. Though I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll be playing online any time soon, the local multiplayer is super fun with a friend or two. In these games, the players choose their characters and rules for the game. It&rsquo;s just a shame that you have to select a premade robot, loadout,&nbsp; and control scheme. It would have been cool to customize their weapon loadout and make something that suits our needs specifically. Speaking of which, players can also unlock customization options by playing through the campaign. They&rsquo;re just cosmetic, but it&rsquo;s a nice touch. There are also Hole of Fame challenges in which players can compete for the top spot in fastest speed and fewest strokes for each hole, as well as playing a marathon of all 36 holes in the game. Though for some reason, they decided to only put the person with the best score up, but not the rest of the leaderboard! What&rsquo;s the point of having a spot in the ranks if you can&rsquo;t see how well you need to do to move up?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as the campaign goes, you hop from mission to mission, going through the story 2 to 3 holes at a time until finally reaching the conclusion. Depending on their performance, the player can earn bronze, silver, and gold medals which can be spent at the shops for more skin upgrades. The whole thing will take about 3 to 4 hours to play through, but the challenges and variety are pretty fun, even if the presentation is lacking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the presentation&rsquo;s kind of a mixed bag, how&rsquo;s the gameplay? Pretty much the same. Let&rsquo;s start out with the rules. It&rsquo;s golf. You use a club to hit the ball into the hole. The difference here is that unlike in real golf, the robots play the game simultaneously. This allows for players to get in the way of the ball to block another player&rsquo;s shot and just generally be dicks to one another.&nbsp; Also, because you&rsquo;re in these giant mechs, if something like a building gets in your way, you can use your club or your on-board weapons to get rid of it. The goal of the game differs based on the chosen rules, but it&rsquo;s usually either to be the first into the hole or to get in the hole in the least number of strokes. I love this take on golf and it adds a freshness to the sport that I haven&rsquo;t seen since the last Mario Golf game.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To add even more variety, there are also multiple ways to hit the ball. From the classic power gauge to synchronized swings, to swing calculations for accuracy. Some are better than others for sure, but they&rsquo;re all interesting to play and add to replayability. The only issue here is that the game doesn&rsquo;t give much explanation into how each of these control schemes works. I have no clue how to get full synchronization on my pilot team or how to actually putt with the math controls. Having a bunch of stuff in the HUD doesn&rsquo;t matter much when the game doesn&rsquo;t give any context to the player.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, the game has massive problems with pacing. The ball moves incredibly slow and even slower than that is your robot. It would have been way more fun to be blasting through cities at high speeds causing mass chaos and destruction on the way to the ball, but instead you just kind of awkwardly hobble over or gently hover to the ball. Because of this, it feels less like playing golf with giant robots and more like playing with remote controlled robot toys.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the biggest issue with the gameplay has to be the massive amount of glitches and poor design choices in place here. The ball doesn&rsquo;t always follow the trajectory shown, the terrain isn&rsquo;t always consistent in its friction, the ball will get stuck inside walls and in places where it can&rsquo;t be taken out, and sometimes the ball teleports back to the beginning of a hole instead of back one stroke after going out of bounds. It&rsquo;s not the existence of these glitches that bothers me, but rather the sheer frequency with which they occur. It&rsquo;s really disappointing and really drags down what should have been an amazing golfing game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, I really like 100ft Robot Golf. It has a ton of charm and personality, but I can&rsquo;t let that stop me from being honest about its flaws. It&rsquo;s a complete blast to play for a little while, but after a short time you realize that the game is just a buggy, glitchy mess with terrible voice acting and really odd design choices. So it&rsquo;s with a heavy heart that I give 100ft Robot Golf on the PS4&hellip; 6 Arnold Palmers, out of 10. If you&rsquo;re looking for an accurate golf simulator, it&rsquo;s not here, but if you&rsquo;re looking for some fun couch competition until the next Mario Golf gets released, you may want to check this one out. With that being said, I want to point out that for my review system a 5 out of 10 is average, so this game is above average. And I really do hope No Goblin ends up making a sequel that fixes the problems present here because if they do I&rsquo;ll be first in line to give it a try! Well, I hope you all enjoyed the review. If you did be sure to subscribe to see more game reviews and next week&rsquo;s nifty recipe based on this game. And as always, have a mighty nifty day today!&nbsp;</span></p>
