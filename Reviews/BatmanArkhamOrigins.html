                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Batman Arkham Origins is the 3rd game in the Arkham series.&nbsp; While developer Rocksteady were busy making the true finale to the trilogy Arkham Knight, they had Warner Bros. Montreal take over for a prequel, released in 2013.&nbsp; The previous games are both fantastic, with tense stealth elements and a combat system still being ripped off to this day, the games really made you feel like Batman.&nbsp; So, does this game live up to that standard?&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s find out in my review of&hellip; BATMAN: ARKHAM ORIGINS!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arkham Origins is the story of the events leading up to the construction of the infamous Arkham Asylum from the first game.&nbsp; Being a prequel, it stars Batman two years into his vigilante career.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s still seen as a threat by police, a myth by criminals, and being questioned about his life choices by his butler, Alfred.&nbsp; The story takes place on Christmas eve, and after killing the police commissioner the villain Black Mask hires 7 vigilantes to kill Batman for a huge bounty.&nbsp; Each of the assassins also has their own specialty.&nbsp; Copperhead has poison, Deadshot has gunplay, Bane has brute strength, and so on.&nbsp; Oh, and Joker&rsquo;s here, played by Troy Baker doing his best Mark Hamill impression.&nbsp; And he does a great job, just like the other voice actors in the game, although the &ldquo;cockney&rdquo; accents by penguin and his assistants are really awful, even for something meant to be cartoonish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The music is great as always, but with a Christmassy twist on the classic soundtrack with chimes and bells added in making for a nice touch. The graphics are about the same as Arkham City, which is to say not all that special considering that this game came out two years later.&nbsp; And unfortunately, they still haven&rsquo;t managed to make Gotham feel like a real city.&nbsp; It all feels like a place designed to be in a video game, which is fine since gameplay is always more important than presentation, but if older games like Infamous and even Spider Man 2 can nail this aspect of a game, Batman deserves to stalk Gotham on a night when people roam the streets and drive their cars around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story is alright, with some plot twists I didn&rsquo;t see coming and a dark tone that&rsquo;s very nice to see Batman in.&nbsp; The darker world leads to more intimidating villains, as you believe they might actually kill people and make you feel responsible for not saving them.&nbsp; That being said, there are definitely some characters thrown in for show and not much else, such as Penguin&rsquo;s brief appearance.&nbsp; It feels cheap instead of being necessary or motivated.&nbsp; On top of that, of all the characters they bring out on Christmas Eve with snow everywhere, no Mr. Freeze?!&nbsp; </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sigh.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Either way, the story is competent and makes me want to see what&rsquo;s coming next, which is all you can really hope for in a game like this.&nbsp; However, how does Batman have access to some of his best gadgets now that he didn&rsquo;t have until Arkham City?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; This is a prequel to the other games and WB Montreal chose the lazy route of giving him the same shit he had before.&nbsp; Even with something like the grappling hook, why not make it more like the classic hook that didn&rsquo;t pull Batman up?&nbsp; He could&rsquo;ve swung through the city like Spiderman, just like he does in the animated series.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a minor complaint, but a valid one for sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game runs pretty consistently with only a few frame drops occurring during big fights, but again, in a city where there are no people around to take up graphics processing it&rsquo;s kind of sad that they can&rsquo;t get like 30 goons on screen to fight at once.&nbsp; Still, the best part of the presentation in Arkham Origins is the combat system.&nbsp; When fighting in the previous Arkham games, the animations were cool, but counters and takedowns had only a few variations between them.&nbsp; By the end of these games, Arkham City in particular, the combat started to feel repetitive simply because I had to see the same animations over and over again.&nbsp; In this game, the animations are much more varied.&nbsp; Countering when standing next to someone has a different animation than if you&rsquo;re further away.&nbsp; Same with different points in someone&rsquo;s attack, what weapon they&rsquo;re using, taking out multiple guys at once, etc. etc. I just wish the lines they say while fighting and during the predator missions had more variations.&nbsp; Especially given how many times you have to fight in this game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arkham Origins plays exactly like Arkham City.&nbsp; The combat might be a bit faster and snappier, but in overall, it feels identical.&nbsp; Okay, so to start off- combat.&nbsp; The combat system is almost exactly the same as Arkham City in that you mash square to fight, triangle to counter, circle to stun special enemies, and X to get behind them.&nbsp; My biggest problem is still very much in this game, in that you can&rsquo;t counter out of a takedown, which makes no sense seeing as how you can counter just about anything else thrown at you.&nbsp; The only major difference is in the electrocutioner&rsquo;s gloves which you get about â…” of the way through the game.&nbsp; By fighting you charge them up, then you can activate them to get stronger for a few seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gloves are nice, but they aren&rsquo;t enough to freshen up a combat system that&rsquo;s needed a new coat of paint for a few years now.&nbsp; I will say that the AI has improved and can be a real challenge sometimes.&nbsp; I probably died more in this game than in the other two games combined.&nbsp; But overall, if it weren&rsquo;t for the new animation system, fighting would be pretty damn stale, even if it is still fun to knock out bad guys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;As far as the predator segments go, they&rsquo;re exactly the same as Arkham City! Sure, they might have a couple of new gadgets to play with, but EVERYTHING else is the exact same! On top of that, these segments are my favorite part of the Arkham games and there&rsquo;s practically none in this game compared to the other two!&nbsp; The developers probably noticed that there weren&rsquo;t a lot of new things to do, so figured that by having less stealth segments people wouldn&rsquo;t get bored of them before the end of the game.&nbsp; And honestly, they were right.&nbsp; The segments are still fun, but by the end, I was mostly left disappointed by small amount of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the main story, there are side objectives to complete involving various villains in Batman lore, including the infamous Riddler challenges.&nbsp; Most of these involve going to a place on the map and then either beating some guys up, solving a stupidly simple puzzle, or hitting a target.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t engaging! There are so many of these challenges that have no real purpose other than to keep you busy and extend the playtime and it just gets boring after a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the bright side, getting around Gotham is fun.&nbsp; Flying around super quick and getting a really long flight going are still very satisfying.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard people complain about the bridge taking forever to get through, but honestly it takes like 20 seconds and I don&rsquo;t mind it.&nbsp; Plus, if it&rsquo;s too much of a hinderance you can take the Batwing to drop points on the map.&nbsp; Although the loading cutscene is so long you might be able to get there faster by flying.&nbsp; The side missions involving boss fights with the assassins also tend to be really fun.&nbsp; As do the ones in the main mission, except Deathstroke.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand why this fight gets so much praise.&nbsp; All you do is counter him when he attacks, then take a few swings.&nbsp; Rinse and repeat for what feels like 20 minutes and I don&rsquo;t care how cool the animation is.&nbsp; The fight is repetitive and boring!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, this game was an okay attempt to recreate what the first two Arkham games had.&nbsp; WB Montreal did improve on a couple of aspects of the game, but fell flat on a lot of others.&nbsp; Had a bit more effort been put into the game design and story, this game had the potential to rival its predecessors.&nbsp; As it stands, the game is a good return to Gotham and fun while it lasts.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re planning on playing the Arkham franchise, I&rsquo;d recommend starting with this game and moving chronologically to go from worst to best in terms of quality.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to give Batman: Arkham Origins.. 7 broken necks out of 10.</span></p>
