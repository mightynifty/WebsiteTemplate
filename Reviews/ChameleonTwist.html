                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chameleon Twist is a game made for the N64 in 1997. Developed by Japan System Supply, it&rsquo;s another cartoony platformer from an era where those completely dominated the gaming scene. This one&rsquo;s gimmick is the ability to control your tongue, using it to reach far away objects and assist you in traversing the environment. It&rsquo;s a more obscure title, with very little in terms of reviews. Is this a hidden gem or just another platformer trying to cash in on the craze? Let&rsquo;s find out in my mighty review of&hellip; Chameleon Twist!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&rsquo;s start off with the story. A chameleon is on a log minding its own business when the white rabbit from Alice in Wonderland hops by and he&rsquo;s HIGH AS FUCK. He hops into a magic cauldron and disappears. The chameleon is curious and hops in after him and is transformed into a humanoid creature in a strange world. The chameleon then goes through the worlds one stage at a time, defeating bosses and&hellip; yeah, that&rsquo;s it. There&rsquo;s no backstory, no reason to fight anything, no motivation for anything. Hell, I don&rsquo;t even know if the bosses are bad guys. I mean, who knows? Maybe the rabbit is evil and I&rsquo;m the bad guy? Maybe this is really just a drug trip the rabbit put me on to use me to take out his enemies and I&rsquo;m just a pawn in this overall scheme maybe&hellip; maybe&hellip; aaaaaand I&rsquo;m thinking way too much into this, aren&rsquo;t I?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, well let&rsquo;s take a look at the worlds. 6 stages to start off with, and 4 characters to choose from. I chose the orange guy because, I don&rsquo;t know, something about him just connects with me. And off we go on our adventure. The core gameplay involves running, jumping, and using your tongue to make your way around the environment and reach the end. Using your tongue you can grab onto posts to pull yourself towards them or just spin around in a circle. You can also reach higher platforms by STANDING ON YOUR TONGUE. Look at this! I can barely stand on my legs, let alone this! Finally, you can use the tongue to eat multiple enemies and then spit them out machine-gun style, like Yoshi on crack. It&rsquo;s actually kind of cool since the more enemies you eat, the bigger your head gets and the slower you move. You can also grab these crowns, but I dunno what they do so I mostly just ignored them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I get to the end of the first level and fight a big super saiyan monkey, knock him off a cliff, and celebrate. No onto level two. The thing I noticed here is that the camera is really bad. It has a tough time tracking the player&rsquo;s movement and is a pain to get in the right place. Also, the tongue controls suck. You have very little control over where your tongue is going to go since the analog stick only moves in 2 dimensions while the tongue moves in 3. This usually isn&rsquo;t too much of an issue, but I swear my gameplay time would have been cut in half had it not been for the poor controls. At the end of this level I fight a bug lady and kick her ass.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other 4 levels are pretty much the same, but with a different coat of paint. However there&rsquo;s still room for some incredibly terrible design choices or some incredibly unfair enemy placements. The bosses were all simple so far, either being super lame or pathetically easy, but now I&rsquo;m on to the final boss of the first act of the game. It takes a couple tries, but I manage to beat him. And now that the tutorial part of the game is over, I&rsquo;m totally ready to see what&rsquo;s next&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&hellip; &hellip; ...Wait, what? That&rsquo;s it? That&rsquo;s the whole game?! You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me! Two hours in and it&rsquo;s already over? And all that&rsquo;s left for me to do is play the terrible multiplayer mode? What a rip off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This game kinda just sucks. It has a great idea at its core, but the terrible controls, awful camera, and the fact that is only has 6 fucking levels keep this game from being anything but shovelware. I can&rsquo;t really recommend this to anyone, which is why I&rsquo;m giving Chameleon Twist for the N64&hellip; a 3 out of 10. That being said I hope you enjoyed this review.
