                        <p>Fall Guys is definitely the most difficult game to place on this year's list. A super unique experience, this 60-man Mario Party-style battle royale took the gaming world by storm when it released in early August, likely boosted by the fact that it was free on PS+. In fact, I was planning to buy the game until I saw that it was free so it worked out pretty well for me. And what resulted was one of the most mixed gaming experiences of my life. With some incredible highs due to the fantastic level design, wonderfully fun art style, and super catchy music being placed between lows interspersed throughout from server issues, poorly thought out game mechanics, some malfunctioning controls, and a serious lack of features. I even made an entire video on the game trying to suggest potential fixes to the developers. All in all whether you got the game for free or paid for it Fall Guys is absolutely worth your time, but due to the issues mentioned I feel like the game's longevity is on a time limit without some major future patches. The team’s already done a lot to make some of the less interesting rounds more fun, but we’ll have to wait and see if it manages to survive with time.</p>
