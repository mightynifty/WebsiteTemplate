                        <p>The point and click adventure genre hasn't exactly had the renaissance treatment that other old school games seemed to get. Growing up I remember games like Monkey Island, King's Quest and Putt Putt being everywhere, but they seem to have died out over time. This year we got an admirable attempt to reinvigorate this type of game with There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension. Explaining the story for this one would probably spoil it a bit, but in general you take the role of the game's player as you try to play while the game attempts to prevent you from doing so. Along the way you get into various misadventures, travel into other games, and maybe have a laugh or two. However, while I did chuckle every once in a while, the game isn't really as funny as it thinks it is and the parts that try to be genuinely touching kinda just fall flat, partially due to the mediocre voice acting. Still, if you're a fan of point-and-clicks, I'd say this is a pretty good time with plenty of cool gameplay tricks, puzzles, and out of the box thinking with meta commentary on the gaming industry as a whole, so it might be worth checking out. But as a total package itâ€™s not much to write home about.</p>
