                        <p>I Am Dead is a difficult game to pin down. You play as Moris Lupton, the deceased former museum curator on the island of Shelmerston. After drifting around for a while as a ghost, he reunites with his old dog Sparky who tells him they need to find a new custodian, a person who can appease the island spirits and prevent the volcano from erupting. To do this, they travel to various locations looking into the memories of the living in order to find enough objects for Sparky to sniff out other deceased residents, allowing them to ask if they’re willing to become the next custodian. See what I mean when I say hard to describe? In short, you figure out which items to look for and click around the environment, using the ability to see through objects to locate what you need before contacting the spirit. There’s not really much of a challenge to it, but that also prevents the game from being frustrating. There are also optional objectives in certain rooms where you can locate creatures called grenkins by cutting and rotating objects in specific ways. While the game isn’t challenging, it has a distinct charm and just feels warm and cozy to play. The voice acting, especially from Moris is superb and the visuals are basic, but stylized in a way that gives the whole island a life of its own. The story isn’t anything moving or profound, but it does always leave you wanting to learn more. It’s the perfect way to relax and just take your mind off of the world by absorbing yourself in the people and culture of this little island. As such, this won’t be a game for everybody, but if you’re looking for the gaming equivalent of a warm, fuzzy blanket I’d say give I Am Dead a shot.</p>
