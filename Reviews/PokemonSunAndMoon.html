                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This game&hellip; is the best Pokemon game in years! The formula is still the same- pick your starter, catch pokemon, defeat an evil organization, and battle your way to the elite four to become the best like no one ever was, but a lot has been switched up this time around. First, this game is incredibly cinematic with unique camera angles and beautiful cutscenes that compliment the engaging and genuinely hilarious story perfectly. The locales, pokemon, and characters all have excellent designs that adhere to the Hawaiian aesthetic really well and the whole game has a diverse color palette that makes everything a delight to the eyes. And the music is on par with any other game in the series which is to say, awesome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story is hilarious when it wants to be and gets legitimately sad when it needs to be. I&rsquo;ve never been this invested in a Pokemon story before. Team Skull has to be my favorite evil organization to date, making me laugh my ass off multiple times during my playthrough. All of your friends in this game are fun too. Lillie is useless, but grows to become a great character, Hau is a fun rival, and Gladion is the dickhead rival we&rsquo;ve all been wanting since generation 2. The best part is that none of them are onenote and they each have scenes that show real depth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now onto the gameplay and there are so many great changes here it&rsquo;ll be difficult to list them all. First, THANK GOD, HMs have been completely removed from the game! Instead you ride around on various Pokemon you come into contact with during your journey. And you can ride them in a surprising number of places making travel a breeze. During battle you can now see the stat changes that both you and your opponent have undergone as well as the effectiveness your moves have on your opponent. There are also new moves called Z moves that can be used once per battle. Some pokemon have moves specifically for them, but every type has one as well so unlike mega evolutions no one&rsquo;s left out here. These are really powerful, but not strong enough to completely break the game, just enough to add another layer of depth to battles. A pokemon can also have its IVs raised through hyper training with Mr. Hyper, which is great for the competitive scene.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of gym leaders you have to go through trials which usually consist of either defeating some wild pokemon and then a supercharged totem pokemon with increased stats or a typical battle against the island champions and kahunas. Wild pokemon can now also call for help from other pokemon to join them in battle, which adds a new layer to the typical wild pokemon fight, keeping it from getting too stale. The game is perfectly paced with barely a moment to breathe between set pieces, going from battle to battle I never once had to grind by beating up wild pokemon for experience, but definitely faced a challenge or two along the way. The post-game content is pretty great too. It took me about 23 hours to become the champion trying to get through as fast as possible over the weekend for the review and I haven&rsquo;t finished everything after that, but it&rsquo;s definitely more expansive than X and Y with ultra beasts, legendaries, and hidden collectables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only negatives I have with the game are nitpicks. The stat change screen is nice, but it would&rsquo;ve been better if it had my pokemon&rsquo;s stats displayed as well and not just the changes to them. The tutorials and cutscenes can border on invasive, with hardly any time given to just explore, but when a series is 7 generations in it&rsquo;s totally understandable to need time to explain the mechanics to new players. The only major issue is slowdown. Even with 3D being removed from battles for this game the framerate dips quite a bit. Still, none of that is enough to change the fact that this is the best Pokemon game in years and exactly the change that the franchise needs, balancing new and old with a finesse that I was starting think Gamefreak lost. Pokemon Sun and Moon gets a 9.5 out of 10 and get a proud spot on the MightyNifty must-play list!</span></p>
