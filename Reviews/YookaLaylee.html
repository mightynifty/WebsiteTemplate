                        <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">I love platformers. I&rsquo;ve loved them ever since first playing video games. And Banjo-Kazooie is one of my favorites. After Microsoft bought Rare, it seemed like we&rsquo;d never get another true sequel to Banjo Kazooie. Until the original creators of that game came together to create a spiritual successor called Yooka-Laylee. It&rsquo;s incredibly similar from the gameplay to the dialogue, and I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to trying it out ever since it was first announced. And now that it&rsquo;s out I can honestly say&hellip; well, we still don&rsquo;t have that spiritual successor, but they tried.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">This game is the biggest mixed bag I&rsquo;ve ever played! It&rsquo;s absolutely baffling. One moment, I&rsquo;m having a blast and reliving my childhood. The next I&rsquo;m screaming at the game for being broken or just downright unfun. Where do I even start?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Well, the story is simple so let&rsquo;s start there. The Evil Capital B. is in his lair working on an evil scheme to steal all of the world&rsquo;s books in an attempt to grant his production company a monopoly on the market. He also wants to snag a powerful magical book. This book belongs to Laylee, who is out sunbathing with her pal Yooka when B&rsquo;s book magnet sucks the book away. As it&rsquo;s flying through the air, some of the book&rsquo;s pages manage to escape and are hidden inside Capital B&rsquo;s factory. Wanting the book back in case it&rsquo;s worth some money, Yooka and Laylee set off on an adventure to retrieve all of the book&rsquo;s pages, defeat Capital B, and get Laylee&rsquo;s book back.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The characters are all charming and fun, just like a Saturday morning cartoon. Yooka and Laylee are basically just Banjo and Kazooie with new skins, but Capital B, his cronies, and the rest of the main cast all do a serviceable job of being cute and fun. It&rsquo;s not deep, but it works. There are a lot of puns, light jabbing at each other&rsquo;s features, and silly moments. A couple of times I even laughed out loud from the absurd humor. But usually, it&rsquo;s just some kid-friendly entertainment to fill in the gaps between gameplay. Although considering that each world is contained in a book called a tome, it&rsquo;s a shame none of the worlds have a central story type of mission to fit the storybook theme. Still, the idea is really creative, reminiscent of jumping into paintings in Mario 64. Nothing mindblowing, but if I had a kid I wouldn&rsquo;t mind watching a Yooka-Laylee tv show with them.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Visually, the game is okay. It&rsquo;s running on the Unity engine, so there isn&rsquo;t a lot going on behind the scenes, but it does function. The lighting effects are good, the textures work well, and the character designs are mostly unique and varied. Plus, the old Rare trope of putting giant googly eyes on everything is still fun, going to the point of the eyes themselves being an enemy capable of bringing whatever they&rsquo;re on top of to life. The environments are well designed and each have a unique aesthetic with cool themes such as tribal, ice, spooky swamp, casino, and space. The animations are fluid as well, being very bouncy and fun to really emulate the feeling of playing through a cartoon.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Still, there are some gripes. The loading screens, while not notably long or short, have this janky movement that makes it look like the game is crashing. The energy bar is the same, with a jerky motion. There are also a lot of places where you can see right through the wall to the skybox and through some solid objects. And of course, there are graphical bugs. So. Many. Bugs. Mostly just things like floating in the air over a platform or infinitely falling instead of standing on something, but it&rsquo;s really prevalent and irritating.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The music, however, is incredible! Grant Kirkhope, Steve Burke, and David Wise together on one soundtrack is a dream team made in heaven. Everything manages to suit the environment being played in, the tone being portrayed, the cartoony feeling of the game, and the classic sound of N64 platformers all while being completely new and fresh. You even get the modified versions when transformed or underwater. I really can&rsquo;t sing its praises enough. After this review, there is supposed to be an update with a fully orchestral version of the soundtrack, but given that I have to rate the game as is, I&rsquo;d still say it&rsquo;s the best soundtrack of the year so far.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Of course, with the good comes the meh. This next point is really up to personal opinion, but the voices. Playtonic decided to give each character grunts and sound bites for voices instead of full voice acting, just like in the older games. The thing is, the older games did this because the N64 cartridges didn&rsquo;t have a ton of memory, with this method being a compromise to save on the space audio files would take up. Nowadays, it can be annoying to some people. For the most part I didn&rsquo;t mind it and even enjoyed it with characters such as Cartos and Shovel Knight, but I can see why people would be irritated. I really wish there had been an option for full voice acting or at the very least, an option to turn off the grunts.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The goal of the game is to collect all of the Pagies, living pages that escaped for Laylee&rsquo;s book. You do this by completing various challenges throughout each of the 5 worlds. There could be a race, helping out a character in need, or just finding them scattered throughout the world. However, each world has pagies for collecting 200 feathers scattered around, 5 ghosts with unique requirements for collection, a boss fight, a cart-riding mini game, and 2 from playing the retro arcade games. There&rsquo;s also Trowser the snake, who will offer new moves in exchange for collected feathers. These are usually cool and make traversal much more fun.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The missions are all over the place in terms of quality. Collecting hidden objects, solving simple puzzles, beating a boss, and other simple challenges are usually really fun, but the cart riding games, retro games, and physics-based games are usually atrocious. There are a few reason for this.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The first are the controls. They&rsquo;re easily the worst part of the game. Some moves work well, others don&rsquo;t. For example, grappling to things with your tongue works well from the ground, but using it in the air results in a failed grab. The Cartos games could be fun, but despite the 2D feel, the hit detection is horrible and shots fire into 3D space, resulting in a lot of misses. Plus things come into frame way too late to react to them.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The biggest control issue I had however, was turning. Whether it be in the air, on the ground, underwater, or anything else, turning in this game sucks. They focused so much on making the game animate well that they forgot in a platformer, when I want to change directions the characters should immediately be going in the opposite direction, not pulling a wide u-turn to circle back. This is easily the biggest issue with the game and drags it down from a great game to a mediocre one.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Then you have the camera and it&rsquo;s pretty bad. Like, it&rsquo;s worse than any camera I&rsquo;ve used since the early 2000s. It gets stuck on walls, bounces around, doesn&rsquo;t give players complete control, and often makes the game more difficult than it needs to be. The energy bar is also an annoyance. It only comes into play like once every 10 or 20 missions and the rest of the time hinders your ability to navigate the world quickly.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Lastly, the worlds are way too big! They each only have a few more things to do than the worlds of Banjo Kazooie, but are easily 3 to 4 times the size. It&rsquo;s completely unnecessary and makes everything much more confusing to navigate and take forever to get to. This is partially due to the fact that each world has an expansion to it, unlocked with extra pagies. If I had to guess, this is because it&rsquo;s more cost-effective to expand a world with the same assets instead of creating new ones, but the end result is a world that&rsquo;s way too big and confusing. Everyone seems to complain about the hub world for its size and confusion and while I do wish passages between worlds had signs to show where they lead, I was more lost trying to find my way around the levels themselves.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.656;text-indent: 36pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Yooka-Laylee is just an average game. There are a lot of high points, but the low points are so crucial to the game that it would be inexcusable for me to look past them. It&rsquo;s both a great throwback, proving that 3D collect-a-thons can work in today&rsquo;s gaming scene, and a disappointment, being nowhere near as good as the older games. Which is why my final score for Yooka-Laylee on the PS4 is a 6.5 out of 10. I really hope they get a sequel to fix up the blatant mistakes present here, but if not I&rsquo;m still hopeful that A Hat In Time and Mario Odyssey can breathe new life into the 3D platforming scene.
