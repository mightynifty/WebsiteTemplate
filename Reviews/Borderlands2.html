                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Borderlands 2 is Gearbox Software&rsquo;s follow up to the moderately successful first-person shooter, Borderlands.&nbsp; The series is all about RPG influenced cooperative shoot em up gameplay. &nbsp; I was personally a little disappointed with the first Borderlands, but was told this game had more of a focus on the story and comedy, so I was excited to give a franchise I saw a lot of potential in another shot.&nbsp; So let&rsquo;s take a look at Borderlands 2!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story of Borderlands 2 picks up from where the story of the first game left off. Wait, there was a story in Borderlands 1?!&nbsp; ...Anyway, a man named handsome Jack has taken control of Pandora after selling a rare substance known as eridium which became available after the vault hunters from the first game destroyed the monster and opened the vault.&nbsp; Now a new set of vault hunters has come to Pandora to investigate rumors of a new vault on the planet.&nbsp; After narrowly escaping a murder attempt at the hands of Handsome Jack, the Vault hunter meets Claptrap, who accompanies them on a trip to Sanctuary, a city safe from the clutches of Jack and his company, the Hyperion corporation.&nbsp; They are told to do this by Angel, a mysterious girl who appears on screen sometimes for no discernable reason and without explanation as to how.&nbsp; Once in Sanctuary, the player meets up with the four vault hunters from the previous game and begins an adventure to take down Handsome Jack and Hyperion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story&rsquo;s alright, though a bit more heavy than I expected.&nbsp; Given the advertisements all making this game out to be a comedy, I didn&rsquo;t expect moments that tug on the heartstrings (which I won&rsquo;t spoil here, but trust me, they&rsquo;re in here).&nbsp; The comedy is okay, with subtle references and not-so-subtle references to pop culture everywhere.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t exactly die of laughter, most likely because a lot of the references are already outdated.&nbsp; It serves its purpose, but it&rsquo;s nothing that will grip you until the very end.&nbsp; The characters are amazing though.&nbsp; Handsome Jack is enough of a dick to get you riled up and want to shoot him in the face, but the game goes ahead and shows that he&rsquo;s a human being too.&nbsp; An actual character.&nbsp; A relatable one.&nbsp; (Are we sure this is Borderlands?!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Borderlands is known for being one of the few series left that still uses the cell-shaded graphics style and it looks pretty nice.&nbsp; If nothing else, it lends a unique feel to the world you won&rsquo;t find in most games.&nbsp; It is a bit strange seeing the really nice, realistic water compared to everything else, but you get used to it.&nbsp; The music complements the world and gameplay well.&nbsp; Its deep guitar gives it an almost western feel to the action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, Borderlands 2 has quite a few issues presentation-wise as well.&nbsp; When loading into an area everything is missing textures which take a couple of seconds to load up.&nbsp; They could have just made the loading screen two seconds longer and not broken the immersion, but it&rsquo;s not a huge deal.&nbsp; No, the huge deal comes down to two aspects- first, whenever angel appears on screen the whole game freezes for a split second, which normally isn&rsquo;t too distracting, but during combat I was yelling at her to shut the fuck up.&nbsp; Second, and most unfortunately, the frame rate has some issues.&nbsp; When in combat the frame rate dips a bit, but when playing with four other players it fucking minimizes.&nbsp; I figured it went down to around 10 fps quite frequently during multiplayer, which is really bad when that&rsquo;s really the only way to play the game.&nbsp; Speaking of which...</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Borderlands 2 is a first person shooter with RPG elements thrown in.&nbsp; You go to inhabitants of Pandora, get a mission, go shoot guys, then come back for a reward.&nbsp; The RPG elements come in with the weapons and class upgrades.&nbsp; There are four main character types to pick from: Commando and Siren from the first game and two new additions in the Assassin and the Gunzerker.&nbsp; The main difference between these types is their special ability.&nbsp; Commando gets a turret, the siren has psychic powers, the assassin can become invisible and the gunzerker can go into rage mode and wield two weapons at once.&nbsp; There is also loot to grab everywhere you can look.&nbsp; Money, different weapons, class and grenade mods, typical stuff for the genre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game is a mixed bag for me in this department.&nbsp; On the one hand, the variety of the weapons and great controls make for an excellent FPS.&nbsp; On the other, playing alone is nearly impossible and the RPG elements aren&rsquo;t fleshed out very well.&nbsp; To my first point, the actual PFS gameplay is awesome.&nbsp; Shooting feels satisfying and responsive and the huge variety in guns, weapons, classes, and mods makes for some really chaotic fun if you can find the right loot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guns can also deal elemental effects in addition to damaging your adversaries, with different effects on different targets.&nbsp; For example, fire burns flesh while electricity destroys shields.&nbsp; Cool stuff.&nbsp; The shooting in this game is hands down some of the best I&rsquo;ve played in any game thus far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problems, however, often outweigh the positives.&nbsp; First, money is almost useless in this game.&nbsp; You can use it to buy ammo and... Nope, that&rsquo;s about it since the guns and shields sold at the stores are often far underpowered compared to the loot you find roaming the overworld.&nbsp; The loot itself is another issue.&nbsp; I feel like good loot only drops when you play multiplayer, which is a bad system considering the game is unfairly difficult for solo players as is.&nbsp; On top of that, the frame rate issues can really break you out of the zone, especially when sniping.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard this might just be a PS3 issue, but since I haven&rsquo;t played the other versions I have to assume they&rsquo;re just as bad.&nbsp; Oh, and check this out.&nbsp; Got stuck in this wall within the first hour of playing.&nbsp; The glitches are all over the place in this game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of this would be a problem if it weren&rsquo;t for the fact that the game is terribly designed.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s say you see a side mission that&rsquo;s supposed to be really hard, but it&rsquo;s got a decent amount of experience and some awesome loot as a reward.&nbsp; So you keep trying over and over again until finally beating it.&nbsp; You go to turn it in and get your weapon&hellip; only to realize that it&rsquo;s got a level requirement.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I worked hard to get this weapon, I earned this weapon, I earned the right to be a bit more powerful in my next enemy encounter, but I can&rsquo;t use it.&nbsp; This is one of the biggest issues with the game along with the extremely overpowered enemies, enemy attacks that are practically un-dodgeable, and worst of all, enemy difficulty scaling.&nbsp; The enemies in this game don&rsquo;t change their tactics as they grow in level.&nbsp; They have way more health and their attacks do more damage, but the strategies you employ to beat them are identical.&nbsp; Imagine playing Pokemon with all of pokemon able to level up like normal, but they don&rsquo;t evolve or learn new moves.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d be pretty bored after a while, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest two issues, however can be seen in the final fight, which I won&rsquo;t spoil here.&nbsp; First, one of the baddies had a shield which I could destroy by killing the bot making it, but the bot got trapped underground and the only way for me to get it out was to kill myself.&nbsp; These kinds of glitches are really detrimental to the game and can lower the fun had immensely.&nbsp; On top of that, the final boss doesn&rsquo;t target the player.&nbsp; It has one phase, and in that phase it moves between 3 spots and attacks the center of the arena.&nbsp; By moving to the side, I managed to not get hit even once by the boss and took the bullet sponge down in like 10 minutes.&nbsp; Even worse, my turret was made useless because of the raks everywhere distracting it.&nbsp; Because of course the game wouldn&rsquo;t let me fight the boss 1 v 1. He needed to invite friends along too. Come to think of it, not a single boss in this game could be fought on their own.&nbsp; I understand that putting sidekicks in the area helps the player to get a second wind when they&rsquo;re down, but sometimes I just want to fight a really good boss.&nbsp; The sad part is that Gearbox stayed so inside the box with their game design that it actually holds back the excellent gunplay and good story.&nbsp; Not to mention that these problems occurred while fighting the FINAL BOSS.&nbsp; Thanks for playing our game.&nbsp; Fuck you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I get that Borderlands 2 is supposed to be a cooperative experience, I really do.&nbsp; But if your game has the difficulty scaled to an unfair and frustrating degree for solo players, then solo players aren&rsquo;t going to enjoy it.&nbsp; However, my short time playing multiplayer before PSN forced me to sign out three times in a row showed me the potential this game has.&nbsp; Which is why I&rsquo;m giving Borderlands 2 two ratings.&nbsp; If you have friends to play with and enjoy some great FPS action, Borderlands 2 gets an 8 out of 10.&nbsp; But if you&rsquo;re like me and have no friends&hellip; Borderlands 2 gets a 6 out of 10.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s still okay, but anything that would take this game to new heights is lost without teammates.&nbsp; But hey, it&rsquo;s not all bad.&nbsp; At least I have all of you, right?</span></p>
