                        <p>Much like Rocket Arena, Worms Rumble is an online multiplayer game released for free on PS+ in December of this year. But unlike Rocket Arena, Worms Rumble is a great game! I’m a big fan of the Worms franchise, but Rumble is unlike anything else in the series. You still have side-scrolling gameplay, health bars, the cute little voices, and a lot of the returning weapons like the holy hand grenade, banana bomb, and jetpack, but rather than a turn-based tactical shooter, this is an all-out deathmatch. The controls work surprisingly well, with the worms feeling agile and responsive thanks to the snappy controls and roll move. The weapons are all unique and most of them are really fun to use, each managing to feel unique despite the massive variety. Movement is handled with the left stick and aiming with the right and your goals change depending on the mode selected. Deathmatch is pretty typical, but players can score points by dealing damage in addition to getting kills, encouraging aggressive play. Then there’s the Last Worm Standing rounds which can be played on a team of 3 or solo. This is your typical battle royale, with different zones being filled with poisonous gas over time. Not only are all of these games fun to play, but slowly unlocks the vast array of cosmetics with the absolute omission of microtransactions! That’s right,the only way to earn more items in this game is by playing, which is something you’ll definitely want to do. There are the occasional glitches with firing inputs, the screen can get overwhelmed with too much going on, and the weapons and items can be difficult to make out with everything so zoomed out, but Worms Rumble is a game that I would have happily paid for even if it weren’t on PS+ and I recommend you do the same.</p>
