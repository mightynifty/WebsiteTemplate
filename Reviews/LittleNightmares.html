                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many of you may know, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the game LIMBO. A fun little puzzle platformer with a creepy vibe and an ambiguous story. So when I first heard about Little Nightmares, I was instantly excited. Little Nightmares is a fun little puzzle platformer with a creepy vibe and an ambiguous story, but in 2.5D and with an almost Tim Burton-esque claymation style. It&rsquo;s delightfully twisted and nails that atmosphere, but it may show its influences a bit too proudly for its own good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this game you play as Six, a little girl who&rsquo;s awoken by a dream of a masked lady aboard the world&rsquo;s least fun Disney cruise. You follow her as she attempts to escape the ship and its diabolical inhabitants. Along the way, you&rsquo;ll uncover some new mysteries of the ship and learn about some of its unsavory secrets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right off the bat I want to say how much I love the art style here. It&rsquo;s dark, creepy, dirty, and just plain insane. The way the ship tilts back and forth throughout the whole game gives everything a sense of unease. The environment is really well done and adds to the vibe, but it&rsquo;s the character models and animations that really shine here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long armed janitor makes for an imposing first villain as his reach always make you feel like you&rsquo;re in danger even when getting away. The gluttonous chefs and patrons absolutely ooze disgust. And the way everything moves in jerky, twisted motions makes everything even better. I mean, the patrons could have just stood up and chased Six, but the developers were like, &ldquo;Nah, let&rsquo;s have them crawl toward the little girl like demons!&rdquo; Imagine the creepiest scenes from Spirited Away with the dial turned up to eleven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the visuals aren&rsquo;t the end of the line. The audio is a treat as well. Creaking floorboards, cracking bones, and squishy grotesque sounds are all here, complimented by a great soundtrack that&rsquo;s just as dark and foreboding as the graphics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only issue I have with this game is the story. While the visuals and locales give off a mysterious and desolate feeling, the story gives off a feeling of confusion. Now I know a lot of people will say that the story is intentionally ambiguous to add to the atmosphere and mystery, but overall I felt it was a bit weak. Being mysterious is one thing, but all of that ambiguity has to lead to something whether it&rsquo;s clues to solve the puzzle or hints at what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes. Unfortunately I get the feeling that the developers just thought of a bunch of cool scenarios to include without giving much thought to how they all weave together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While playing Little Nightmares, I got the feeling that the developers saw how LIMBO played and figured they could just make the same game. The controls are tight and simple, although having a button to grab onto ledges is weird, but the game never really takes that simplicity anywhere new. You can run, jump, use a lighter to see around you, and climb all over to traverse the environment and solve puzzles. This is used to great effect, but very rarely does it feel original.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some puzzles have you pushing around boxes to reach a higher platform, which LIMBO did. Others involve using the environment to defeat a mini boss, which LIMBO did. Another has you sneaking around an environment trying not to get caught, which the same studio did in INSIDE. And the problem isn&rsquo;t so much with the similar goals of each puzzle, but rather with the similar solutions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The controls and strategies used to solve puzzles in this game aren&rsquo;t exact copies of LIMBO and INSIDE, but they&rsquo;re pretty damn close. They even have the awesomely brutal death animations when you screw up! Even then, this would all be okay if the game introduced anything new to the table, but in that area it&rsquo;s sorely lacking. The puzzles are fun and the feeling of being chased is heart-pounding, but it never really breaks through to the next level or had anything that made me sit back and remark on how clever a certain puzzle was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s not to say the game is without </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> originality. The swaying of the ship is an aesthetic element, but also a gameplay one as certain things swing or slide around with the ship, bringing some outside the box thinking to the table. And man, those chase sequences go from tense to absolutely terrifying with each escape bringing with it a sigh of relief and a sense f accomplishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, little things like jumps that should have been landed missing or surprise deaths by trial and error can be irritating. In a game like this, nearly every death should be avoidable with a bit of foresight due to the game design, but I can guarantee that anyone playing this game for the first time will, at some point, call bullshit when they die to some arbitrary jump scare.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, and this is just a nitpick, but how do the blind janitor&rsquo;s sense work? It&rsquo;s implied that he smells your character, but only when you&rsquo;re out in the open. And even if you say it&rsquo;s because Six is easier to smell when she&rsquo;s not under cover, it doesn&rsquo;t explain how he smells a child in a room full of sleeping children! Again, it&rsquo;s just a fun nitpick, but a small inconsistency that I noticed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Little Nightmares isn&rsquo;t a LIMBO clone. It&rsquo;s not a carbon copy an it shouldn&rsquo;t be accused of being anything more than a Playdead-inspired game. Even so, if you&rsquo;re going to come out with a game this similar to the one that inspired you, you better bring something new to the table. Little Nightmares does this, but still fails to reach the highs of its predecessor. Still, it&rsquo;s a valiant effort and an experience I&rsquo;ll remember which is why Little Nightmares on the PC gets an 8 out of 10.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could be a little longer, maybe a bit deeper, but overall I enjoyed the game and look forward to what this studio brings us next. With that being said I hope you enjoyed this review. If you did, be sure to like and subscribe to see more mighty reviews, dissections, and other gaming content.
