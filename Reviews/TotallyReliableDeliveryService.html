                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Totally Reliable Delivery Service works on the same premise of games like Goat Simulator and Gang Beasts where the unwieldy nature of the controls and crazy physics are meant to make the gameplay frustratingly hilarious as you go through. Unlike those games however Totally Reliable Delivery Service fails to actually elicit a single chuckle. There are two reasons for this. First, the game simply does not work. It's broken to its core, feeling completely unfinished and buggy. And this could be funny to try out, but then the game's second major flaw comes into play- it doesn't commit to the bit. It tries its absolute damnedest to make sure it has clear objectives and goals, but rather than making achieving those goals silly and fun, it's just an exercise in frustration with every tedious second grinding on the nerves. Missions can take a long time to reach and they aren't very fun when you do give them a try, if they work at all. In a game like Goat Simulator the controls may be loose and imperfect, but they generally make your character do what the player would expect. A glitchy comedy game only works if the player's frustrations are overcome by the silliness of it all and the moment-to-moment experience is quickly carrying them to the next ridiculous setpiece. Unfortunately for Totally Reliable Delivery Service, it's just a frustrating, unfinished mess.</span></p>
