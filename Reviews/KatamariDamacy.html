                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, this game exists.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure how or why, but this game exists.&nbsp; And I fucking love it.&nbsp; Screw the intro I&rsquo;m reviewing Katamari Damacy!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katamari Damacy was released in 2002 by Namco for the PS2 and my god is it weird.&nbsp; You play as the Prince, son of the King of Cosmos.&nbsp; The game starts off with a cutscene where your dad gets super drunk and destroys all the stars in the sky.&nbsp; And he tells you as his son, to pick up random shit on Earth with a Katamari, a ball that makes everything smaller than it stick to it for some reason. Anyway, the king (who refers to himself as both a he and a we for some reason) send you off on this journey starting at the height of about 5 centimeters.&nbsp; Your job is to roll the katamari big enough to make a star out of it.&nbsp; After you&rsquo;ve made your katamari big enough, the King takes it and turns it into a star by blowing it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also cutscenes with this family going to see their dad fly in a rocket to the moon later that day.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t get why these cutscenes are here or how they add to anything, but they have a certain strange charm to them.&nbsp; Except when you beat a constellation.&nbsp; The daughter can &ldquo;sense&rdquo; what&rsquo;s going on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game&rsquo;s look is very colorful and pleasing to the eye.&nbsp; All the objects pop and some even react when being picked up such as animals and people.&nbsp; On top of that everything has a very Japanese feel.&nbsp; Like no, this game could only be made by the Japanese. I love the art style and find it to be very unique.&nbsp; I do wish the locales were more varied though.&nbsp; You start in a house in like 5 different levels and have to go to the same locations in a lot of different levels as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now the music.&nbsp; My god, the music.&nbsp; This game has to be in my top 5 game soundtracks of all time.&nbsp; And that theme makes me so happy!&nbsp; Some of the soundtrack is repeated in later levels, but I don&rsquo;t even care! It&rsquo;s fantastic.&nbsp; Between this and the graphics, I wish more games had the balls to go this outside the box with their presentation because it makes the game feel really unique.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gameplay of Katamari Damacy is super simple.&nbsp; Roll the ball into small stuff to get them to stick.&nbsp; Once your ball gets bigger, you can roll up bigger stuff.&nbsp; Also, you can turbo charge and if you pick up something that makes your ball lopsided your Katamari will do a weird pole-vault-hobble to get everywhere until you smooth out.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s pretty much all you do for the entire game.&nbsp; The are a few variations here and there where you&rsquo;re tasked with collecting a lot of a certain object or collecting the largest of a certain kind of object you can find, but generally you&rsquo;re going to be doing the same thing most of the game.&nbsp; Which is perfectly fine because picking things up with a Katamari is one of the most satisfying feelings ever put into a game! Starting a level by running from snails and growing to the size of picking up buildings feels amazing and powerful.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also oddly relaxing. &nbsp; The game can be challenging your first time through, but after that the only major challenge is getting a large enough Katamari that the King won&rsquo;t scrutinize you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The controls feel kind of weird at first, but they grow on you.&nbsp; Eventually you&rsquo;ll be rolling around like a pro.&nbsp; However, there are a few problems with the gameplay.&nbsp; Rolling into a wall holding forward is supposed to get you to roll your ball over the ledge, but it only works about 50% of the time.&nbsp; I often wished that the game had a jump button instead to allow for easier travel.&nbsp; On top of that, the camera can sometimes get really confused, leaving you completely clueless as to where you&rsquo;re going.&nbsp; And finally, there isn&rsquo;t much indication as to what you can pick up.&nbsp; There were many occasions when I was clearly taller and more massive that what I was going to pick up, but couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure what qualifies this, but it could have been organized better.&nbsp; Maybe have a button causing all of the objects you can pick up to glow briefly?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, while I do like the bit of variety offered with the constellation levels, I do think the addition of some extra gimmicks could have been nice.&nbsp; Maybe rolling the Katamari into some water to roll through flaming bushes to get to a new area, or racing a car with your katamari, or dodgeball.&nbsp; There is so much potential with this concept and while the finished game is really fun, it really sparked my imagination for what could be done in the future.&nbsp; Oh, and going back to the same locations can get repetitive sometimes despite this being a short game to begin with.&nbsp; Though sometimes it&rsquo;s cool to return at a larger size and collect the objects that gave you trouble on your previous trip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of all these flaws the game is still tons of fun to play and really impressive too.&nbsp; I mean, you can go from as small as an ant picking things up inside a house to being large enough to roll up the house you started in without ever seeing a loading screen.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s just a little blurry transition that lasts for about a second allowing the world to shrink relative to your new size every once in awhile.&nbsp; The game runs flawlessly and I never managed to get myself stuck within a level despite actually trying to.&nbsp; Seriously, the game is weird but the programming has some great structure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katamari Damacy is a weird game.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s really weird.&nbsp; But my god do I love it.&nbsp; It has one of the most satisfying mechanics ever put into a game and uses it very well.&nbsp; While I would probably prefer a bit more variety in both the gameplay and level design, I can&rsquo;t fault a game for sticking to its strengths.&nbsp; I give Katamari Damacy 8.5 sticky balls out of 10.</span></p>
