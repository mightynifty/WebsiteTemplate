                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">De Blob is a platforming game made by Blue Tongue Entertainment for the Wii in 2008.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a game in which you take to the streets and color in the world while fighting evil starfish.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an interesting concept, but how does it translate into a game? Let&rsquo;s find out in my mighty review of&hellip; De Blob!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">De Blob starts off with the evil starfish Comrade Black and his army of the INKT corporation sucking all of the color out of the world and enslaving the citizens to *gasp* desk jobs.&nbsp; Blob, being able to take on the color of any ink bot he smashes, is approached by a group of revolutionaries and takes on the task of saving the world, one location at a time.He does this by going around splatting paint everywhere until he finally reaches the color nazi headquarters for the final showdown with Comrade Black.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story is passable, with cute cutscenes thrown in before each mission to explain the new level.&nbsp; The villains are what I imagine minions would be like if they were actually cute and likeable (instead of annoying and insufferable).&nbsp; The characters aren&rsquo;t really fleshed out aside from the kinds of missions they send you on.&nbsp; You have they typical brute, speedy kid, chummy professor, and spunky artist. Without any characterization I have no reason to be invested in these guys or their mission, but kids will probably find them fun to watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The music is fun and comes in a variety of genres, but it&rsquo;s nothing that will stay in your head for a while, though I always appreciate it when a game allows the player to pick a song before playing each level. The graphics are pretty good.&nbsp; Paint splats are everywhere and the draw distance is much larger than you&rsquo;d expect from a Wii game.&nbsp; When you touch almost any white or grey object in the game it becomes flooded with your color.&nbsp; You can also collect different styles around the map that change the pattern of everything you color in.&nbsp; And the big structures have beautiful designs.&nbsp; The downside to the multicolored rainbow aesthetic is that it makes each location feel very samey despite the different themes.&nbsp; The music level looks just like the skating level and so on, just with different structures. And for a game all about bringing life into a colorless world, the people sure are lifeless a lot of the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In De Blob, you paint everything.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the game&rsquo;s only real mechanic.&nbsp; Just grab a color and touch something and it becomes that color.&nbsp; You can get the three base colors of red, blue, and yellow, mix two to get purple, orange, and green, or mix all three to become brown.&nbsp; Using brown makes the city look like its sewer system broke.&nbsp; Each level consists of Blob getting a certain number of points by coloring things, finishing side objectives, and completing missions which open up gates to further parts of the level.&nbsp; While you can just go through a level as quickly as possible, there are also side objectives that can be completed such as coloring every tree or saving all of the citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The enemies you face along the way can be dealt with by slamming into them.&nbsp; Different enemies can take different amounts of paint points to destroy and if you run out of paint and get hit, you die.&nbsp; Some enemies will fire ink at you that must be dodged while others have melee attacks.&nbsp; When inked Blob slowly loses paint points until he touches a source of clean water, though he can still stomp paint bots to get some life back to delay losing a life when the paint points hit zero.&nbsp; Some enemies also require certain colors of ink to kill.&nbsp; Unfortunately even though a game like this practically begs for boss fights there&rsquo;s only one in the game and he&rsquo;s the final boss.&nbsp; And he&rsquo;s pretty shit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The missions in the game come from your fellow revolutionaries.&nbsp; The artist makes you color certain buildings in certain patterns, the brute has you kill a certain number of inkies, the speedster has you race along smoke trails for a bit, and the professor has you use a certain color of paint to restore large buildings to their former glory.&nbsp; None of these missions are particularly difficult and can be accomplished on the first or second try most of the time.&nbsp; And by that I mean these missions are often so clearly laid out and linear that by level 3 I did them not to have fun, but rather as a way to make my points go up faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The levels in this game are huge, with the average time for each of the ten levels being a half hour or so, it can be very daunting starting a new level. And since there are no checkpoints, you won&rsquo;t be able to stop and continue a level later.&nbsp; While I would have prefered smaller chunks of say 15 minutes, they did at least make getting around the levels much easier with Z-jump panels that take you around the level in a flash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main problem with levels this long is that they get very repetitive very quickly.&nbsp; With only 4 main mission types and levels that have a similar style (if you consider paint splashes to be a style) the ends of levels become more tedious than fun as you just do the same things over and over.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s not even mentioning how much the repetition sinks in by the end of the game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, if the game is fun then there&rsquo;s no problem with repeating the fun, right?&nbsp; Well, the game is fun.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s satisfying to paint an entire city and to crush all of the ink enemies in your way.&nbsp; But the game has two major problems that get in the way of it being a real blast to play.&nbsp; First, the camera.&nbsp; The camera in this game really sucks, losing Blob as he falls to his doom or goes behind a building.&nbsp; You can keep it behind Blob with the C button, but who wants to hold a button down the entire length of the game?&nbsp; Not to mention that the camera takes a second to react to your movements and even then moves slowly keeping Blob out of your sight for longer than is comfortable in a platforming game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second issue comes with the controls.&nbsp; The devs really shot themselves in the feet with this one.&nbsp; To start off, Blob can do a wall run by jumping onto a wall and moving forward, but the problem is that he sticks to absolutely anything, making it so that when it&rsquo;s time to get some precision platforming done you get really annoyed because this fucking blob is vacuumed to the wall.&nbsp; You can hit the B button to force him to go down, but sometimes you have to ride over a bottomless pit, so that&rsquo;s not the best idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when you want him on the wall he controls like shit. When he jumps off the wall it&rsquo;s practically impossible to tell which direction he&rsquo;s going to go.&nbsp; And speaking of jumping the person who decided that Blob should jump with a flick of the Wiimote needs to go away, like right now, just go because holy shit is that inaccurate.&nbsp; Well I&rsquo;m sure that since such a vital function is given to an inaccurate input method the A button must be used for something really important, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">De Blob is a passable game.&nbsp; Even with the below average controls I only died once in the whole game.&nbsp; Definitely not something I&rsquo;ll be playing again soon, but it would definitely be a great game for younger kids.&nbsp; Had the controls been tightened up a bit, the game could have been really fun, but at it stands De Blob is just a slightly above average game, which is why I&rsquo;m giving it a slightly above average score of 6 out of 10.&nbsp; Maybe the sequel is better, but I have no clue how I&rsquo;d find that out (pull it over from behind the pillow).</span></p>
