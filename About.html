                                <p>My Name is Steven Callahan aka MightyNifty. I’ve been reviewing and analyzing games for over 5 years. This website will act as a place I can publish reviews and essays about video games. Occasionally these may also be turned into videos, which will be posted both here and on my YouTube channel.</p>

                                <p>The goal of this project is threefold. First, to share my love of gaming with the world. I believe that when you’re passionate about something, that passion is contagious and using the MightyNifty brand I want to explore the art form to see what makes video games special and how we can better connect with them. Second, I want to learn more about the opinions of others and see how they differ from my own. Active discussion is the best way to learn and I love engaging with others who share this same passion. Lastly, I want to learn about game design and eventually develop games of my own. More on that in the future!</p>
