# WebsiteTemplate
An open-source website template for anyone to use.

This website was created with the intention of being copied and modified by fellow YouTubers or content creators. Anyone is free to copy, modify, or expand on the features here.
It's nothing incredible, not optimized for mobile, etc. But it could make for a good starting point and since it only uses HTML, CSS, and JS, it's able to be uploaded to Netlify for free.

If you'd like to support me or thank me for making this template, feel free to tweet me @mightynifty. I'd love to see the sites people make with this template!
